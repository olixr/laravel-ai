## Introduction

The official Laravel AI SDK.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Agents](#agents)
    - [Streaming](#streaming)
    - [Structured Output](#structured-output)

## Installation

You can install the Laravel AI SDK via Composer:

```shell
composer require laravel/ai
```

Or, if this package has not been publicly released yet, you can install it via a Composer "path" repository. First, clone this repository to your local machine, then add the path repository to your application's `composer.json` file:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "./../laravel-ai"
    }
],
```

Then, add `"laravel/ai": "*"` to your Composer dependencies. You will likely also need to adjust your application's `minimum-stability` to `dev`. Finally, run `composer update`.

## Agents

You can create an agent via the package's Artisan commands:

```shell
php artisan make:agent SalesCoach

php artisan make:agent SalesCoach --structured
```

Within the generated agent class, you can define the system prompt / instructions, message context, available tools, and output schema (if applicable).

To prompt an agent, you may use the various methods provided by the agent's `Promptable` trait:

```php
$response = (new SalesCoach)->prompt('Analyze this sales transcript...');

return (string) $response;
```

### Streaming

You may stream an agent's response by invoking the `stream` method. The returned `StreamableAgentResponse` may be returned from a route to automatically send a streaming response to the client:

```php
Route::get('/coach', function () {
    return (new SalesCoach)->stream('Analyze this sales transcript...');
});
```

Alternatively, you may iterate through the streamed events manually:

```php
$stream (new SalesCoach)->stream('Analyze this sales transcript...');

foreach ($stream as $event) {
    // ...
}
```

### Structured Output

If you would like your agent to return structured output, implement the `HasStructuredOutput` interface, which requires that your agent define a `schema` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Ai\Agents;

use Illuminate\Contracts\JsonSchema\JsonSchema;
use Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Agent;
use Laravel\Ai\Contracts\HasStructuredOutput;
use Laravel\Ai\Promptable;

class SalesCoach implements Agent, HasStructuredOutput
{
    use Promptable;

    // ...

    /**
     * Get the agent's structured output schema definition.
     */
    public function schema(JsonSchema $schema): array
    {
        return [
            'score' => $schema->integer()->required(),
        ];
    }
}
```

When prompting an agent that returns structured output, you can access the returned `StructuredAgentResponse` like an array:

```php
$response = (new SalesCoach)->prompt('Analyze this sales transcript...');

return $response['score'];
```
